# Evergreen Notes from Mardown files (Obsidian vault)

Static website to display Markdown notes (eg from an Obsidian vault) in the style of Andy Matuschak evergreen notes.

## Why?

A digital garden is a way to think and build in public.
This is a powerful tool to develop your thinking.

With this project we have two goals:
- Make publishing and sharing notes in the Evergreen format as straightforward as possible
- Make it an intuitive and beautiful experience for the user

### Evergeen notes

Evergreen notes are a convenient and natural way to organise thoughts. They are:
- Atomic
- Concept-centric
- Densely linked

### Obsidian

Obsidian is a great, simple tool to browse, edit, and organise a vault of Markdown files.
With stacked tabs it provides a similar experience to this UI to linking and browsing notes.
Obsidian provides an option to publish notes, but we aim to separate concerns and avoid lockin.

## How?

This website developed with React+Vite is a very simplified application to display Markdown files as stacked notes.
It is greatly, heavily inspired from Andy Matuschak's notes website: https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes.
It requires a separate, automated process in order to build an index of backlinks.
